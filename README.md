## Install
1. Open up your terminal and cd into the `interface` folder
2. Create a new virtual environment by running (command may differ slightly depending on python configuration):
   Windows:
   ```
   py -m venv .venv
   ```
   macOS/Linux:
   ```
   python3 -m venv .venv
   ```
3. Activate the virtual environment:
   Windows:
   ```
   .venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
   macOS/Linux:
   ```
   . .venv/bin/activate
   ```
4. Make sure pip is up to date:
   Windows:
   ```
   pip install --upgrade pip
   pip --version
   ```
   macOS/Linux:
   ```
   pip install --upgrade pip
   pip --version
   ```
5. Install from the `requirements.txt` file:
   Windows:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   macOS/Linux:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
6. Train the data:
   ```
   py training.py
   ```
   macOS/Linux:
   ```
   python3 training.py
   ```
7. Run the server (see the "Run" section)

## Run
1. Initiated the Virual Environment (if not already initiated)
   Windows:
   ```
   .venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
   macOS/Linux:
   ```
   . .venv/bin/activate
   ```

2. Run Flask (with the virtual environment running)
   ```
   flask --app app run --debug
   ```
   macOS/Linux:
   ```
   flask --app app run --debug
   ```

3. Flask will now start a development server. Once running, it will tell you the URL and port it is running on. It will most likely be [http://127.0.0.1:5000](http://127.0.0.1:5000)

4. Go to the URL in the previous step

5. Enter the email into the text box (some sample emails are provided in the "Test Emails" section) and click "Submit"

6. The results will be displayed below the submit button along with the result of each algorithm

7. To shut down the server, in the terminal Flask is running in, enter CTRL + C (COMMAND + C for macOS)
